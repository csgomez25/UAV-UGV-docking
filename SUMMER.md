# Summer Pre-Work Plan (get-ahead, before the fall timeline)

> Situation (June 2026): no course deadline yet. **2-person summer crew** — you (all software/autonomy) + a friend (structural + electrical). 1–2 more teammates expected when the course starts in fall.
>
> Goal of the summer: **de-risk + learn + secure long-lead parts** so that when the course starts you're past the slow, painful early phase instead of rushing for parts and fighting toolchains. Not "have a flying autonomous drone by August" — that's not the goal and would be a trap.

## Why this timing is good
- **Summer load is fine even though you're doing all the software solo** — because it's *sim + learning + bench work*, not a graded deliverable on a clock. Doing the whole software stack yourself first is the **best possible autonomy-engineer education**: you'll understand every box before you hand some off in the fall.
- The slowest, most frustrating parts (toolchain setup, VIO learning curve, long-lead/low-stock parts) are exactly the things worth front-loading into a no-pressure summer.

---

## YOU this summer — software + VIO ramp
Run these roughly in parallel:

1. **Sim bring-up** — work through [SIM_WEEK1.md](./SIM_WEEK1.md). Target: the Day-7 autonomy loop (depth → nvblox → A* → offboard) flying around an obstacle in sim. *This is the Phase-1 gate.*
2. **VIO learning track** (your priority skill) — start the offline ladder from ROADMAP:
   - Labbe's Kalman/Bayesian Filters → run **OpenVINS on the EuRoC dataset** → implement a **toy VI-EKF on EuRoC** offline.
   - Get **cuVSLAM running in sim**, then on the **bench** once the RealSense + Jetson arrive.
   - Learn **Kalibr** (camera–IMU calibration) — you'll use it for real in the fall.
3. **Start the lab-notebook git repo** (this folder is a good seed) — log every working command + failure.

**Your summer "done":** sim autonomy loop works; you can explain VIO and have cuVSLAM running in sim + on the bench; EuRoC toy filter implemented.

## YOUR FRIEND this summer — structural + electrical
Maps to the Hardware role in ROLES.md (Teammate C). Concrete tasks:

1. **Assemble the Holybro X500 V2** — frame, motors, ESC, props, power module.
2. **Flash PX4, calibrate, and get stable MANUAL flight** — props on, open/safe area. This proves the airframe independently of any autonomy.
3. **Design + print the payload mounts** — camera mount, Jetson tray, battery cradle, prop guards. **Vibration isolation for the camera/IMU is the make-or-break detail** (bad damping silently wrecks your VIO — flag this to him as a first-class requirement, not an afterthought).
4. **Wiring + power budget** — clean cabling, connectors, kill-switch wiring, telemetry + ELRS RC link, sensor power/data routing.
5. **Learn:** Oscar Liang (hardware/soldering/ELRS), PX4 assembly docs, Holybro X500 build guide.

**Friend's summer "done":** X500 flies stably under manual control, with mounts + vibration isolation ready to accept the camera/Jetson.

## What to buy NOW vs. wait for fall

> ### ✅ RESOLVED 2026-07-31 — and it went the other way
>
> **Parts choices are ~90% confirmed (Orin Nano Super + RealSense D435i), but the
> budget does not unlock until the course starts.** Nothing can be ordered this summer.
>
> That inverts the plan below, and it changes what the rest of the summer is *for*.
> The binding constraint is no longer money — it is **your time in the fall**, which
> will be consumed by assembly, sensor bring-up, calibration, cuVSLAM integration,
> EKF2 fusion, flight tests, *and* mentoring two new teammates. There is no room in
> that for learning curves.
>
> **So the remaining summer has exactly one job: arrive in the fall with the learning
> curves already climbed.** Three things, all of which are offline and cannot be
> blocked by parts — see "Revised priorities" below.
>
> Note this also means **the Phase-1 sim gate no longer gates anything.** It existed to
> decide "is it safe to buy hardware?", and budget already decided that. Finish it for
> the milestone and the report, but do not let it crowd out the three items below.

### Revised priorities (2026-07-31, hardware budget-locked)

1. ⭐ **The VIO ladder** (ROADMAP steps 1–3: Labbé's filters → OpenVINS on EuRoC → a
   toy VI-EKF). This is the career deliverable, it is entirely offline, and **the fall
   has no room for it**. Partial infrastructure already exists — `~/DPVO` has
   `evaluate_euroc.py` and EuRoC logs. Highest-value hours available.

   > **Status 2026-08-13: step 2 got skipped, and it is now costing time.** OpenVINS was
   > built and pointed straight at the *aircraft* instead of at EuRoC. It stalls in
   > initialisation (`not enough feats to compute disp: 0,47 < 15`), and because it has
   > never been run on a dataset where it is known to work, **there is no reference to
   > diff against** — every hypothesis has to be ruled out from first principles rather
   > than by comparison. Running EuRoC is now simultaneously the career deliverable and
   > the cheapest diagnostic for the live Gate A blocker. Do it first.
   >
   > ✅ **Step 2 done 2026-09-01 — ATE 0.221 m on EuRoC MH_01**, and it bounded the Gate A
   > blocker to the Gazebo side in a single session. **Steps 1 and 3 are still open, and
   > they are the ones this list exists for.** Step 2 had a live blocker pushing it; 1 and
   > 3 have nothing but the fall deadline, which is now here.
2. ⭐ **De-risk Isaac ROS now, on the laptop.** Every decision so far has deliberately
   deferred it (octomap instead of nvblox, rtabmap instead of cuVSLAM, **now OpenVINS
   instead of cuVSLAM**), and BUILD §0.6 warns it is "unverified for longer." The dev box
   can run it: **RTX A3000 6 GB, driver 595.84, 308 GB free**; Docker and the NVIDIA
   Container Toolkit are *still not* installed. Install them, pull the container, run the
   cuVSLAM quickstart on a dataset. That validates the workflow, the ROS interfaces and
   the tuning surface — most of which transfers to the Jetson. **If the Isaac ROS × Jazzy
   × Orin Nano matrix turns out to need Humble, finding out in July is cheap and finding
   out in October with parts on the bench is not.**

   > **Deferred four times as of 2026-08-13**, each time by a decision that was
   > individually correct, which is precisely why this needs scheduling rather than
   > prioritising. Nothing in the sim work will ever force it.
   >
   > ⚠️ **The GPU has already bitten once (2026-08-03), in a way worth knowing before you
   > pull a CUDA container.** Ubuntu ships **prebuilt** NVIDIA modules per kernel version
   > and a kernel upgrade does not carry them over: the box was running `7.0.0-28-generic`
   > with modules only for `6.17.0-{29,35}`. `nvidia-smi` failed, Gazebo silently fell
   > back to the Intel iGPU, and **segfaulted mid-sweep**, invalidating one run and
   > probably two more — while RTF read ~1.0 and the arming delays were healthy, so the
   > usual checks all passed. Fix is the metapackage
   > `linux-modules-nvidia-595-open-generic-hwe-24.04`, which keeps tracking future
   > kernels rather than pinning to one. Separately, `prime-select` is `on-demand`, so
   > **the driver being loaded and Gazebo actually using it are different claims** —
   > only a `gz` process in `nvidia-smi --query-compute-apps` settles the second.
3. **Practice Kalibr on a dataset.** Camera–IMU calibration is the one thing sim
   structurally cannot teach — in sim the extrinsic is exact and free; on hardware it
   is vibration, thermal drift and a fiddly toolchain. EuRoC ships calibration data.
4. ✅ Close the Phase-1 gate — **done 2026-07-31** (it took more than the predicted
   afternoon; the remap was one line and four silent failures had to be fixed around it).
5. Research track: the 2-DOF along-track + heading matcher. *(Untouched since 07-13.)*
6. 🔴 **Added 2026-08-13 — unblock OpenVINS initialisation.** It is the live Gate A
   blocker, and item 1 is the cheapest way at it.
7. ⬜ **Added 2026-08-13 — Gate C, which needs no estimator.** `fake_vio` injects drift of
   a chosen magnitude, so map smear and collision margin under drift are measurable today.
   The only remaining sim work Gate A does not block.

**Stop:** tuning rtabmap ICP. It does not ship (cuVSLAM does), it cannot test the hard
part, and it has already produced its honest finding (`VIO.md` §3b).

> **Extended 2026-08-13: stop tuning rtabmap, full stop.** `rgbd_odometry` — the "then use
> the RGB" successor — is also closed on evidence, both configurations exhausted. The
> lesson that generalises past rtabmap is in `ISSUES.md` F3: the launch file carried a
> confident, well-argued paragraph explaining why it did not need `ResetCountdown=1`, and
> **both halves of it were wrong.** It sat in a list of measured findings, in the same
> voice, with no data behind it, and blocked a ten-minute experiment for a week. **Mark
> predictions as predictions, or they become facts by adjacency.**

---

> ⚠️ **Original buy guidance, kept for the fall.** Confirm the money source; if the
> budget reimburses only from course start, don't float ~$1,100 out of pocket.

**Buy now (long-lead / unblocks summer work):**
- ⭐ **RealSense D435i** — thin stock post-spinout, long lead, and you can bench-test it independently. **Highest priority, buy first regardless.**
- **Jetson Orin Nano (Super)** — unblocks your cuVSLAM bench work. *(Re-verify the Isaac ROS × Orin Nano × Jazzy support matrix before ordering — BUILD.md §0.5.)*
- **Holybro X500 kit + Pixhawk 6C + battery + charger + RC** — unblocks your friend's assembly + manual flight. The platform is committed, so this is low-risk to buy early.

**Wait for fall (cheap, or depends on findings):**
- Spares/contingency, prop guards, netting (likely lab-provided), and anything you'd only spec after the sim phase.

---

## The fall handoff (plan for the team growing to 3–4)
By fall you'll know the whole stack cold, which makes you the natural **software/autonomy lead**. When the 1–2 new teammates join:

- **You keep:** State Estimation / **VIO lead** + autonomy-loop **integration** (your growth target).
- **Hand off:** **planning + obstacle avoidance** to a new teammate (you mentor them — you'll have built it in sim), and **flight control / PX4 tuning** to another.
- **Friend continues:** hardware (mechanical + electrical), now adding the real camera/Jetson integration.

This sets up the exact ROLES.md split, but with you having a summer head-start that lets you lead instead of scramble.

---

## Summer milestones (rough)
*(Original plan — superseded 2026-07-31 by the budget lock; kept for comparison.)*
- **Weeks 1–3:** toolchain + SIM_WEEK1 through Day 4; friend starts X500 assembly; RealSense + Jetson ordered.
- **Weeks 4–6:** sim autonomy loop closed (Phase-1 gate); friend reaches manual flight; OpenVINS-on-EuRoC running.
- **Weeks 7–10:** cuVSLAM in sim + on bench with real RealSense; toy VI-EKF; friend finishes mounts + vibration isolation.
- **End of summer:** sim demo + bench VIO working; airframe flight-ready.

**Revised end-of-summer target (no hardware available):** SIM_WEEK1 Days 1–5 done ✅,
Phase-1 gate closed ✅, **OpenVINS running on EuRoC with a drift number you understand**,
**Isaac ROS + cuVSLAM demonstrated in a container on the laptop**, and Kalibr practised
on a dataset. Bench work moves to the fall, but arrives with no learning curve attached.

> **Progress against that target, 2026-08-13.** Days 1–5 ✅ and the Phase-1 gate ✅, plus
> two things that were never on this list and are worth more than most of it: **the
> aircraft flies with GNSS fusion off** (Gate B) and **the error budget any estimator has
> to meet is measured** (0.5 °/s yaw, ~1.5 m accumulated position). The three learning
> items are all still open. OpenVINS runs, but on the aircraft rather than EuRoC — which
> is the wrong order and is currently the reason its failure is hard to diagnose.
>
> **Updated 2026-09-01.** One of the three learning items is closed: **OpenVINS runs on
> EuRoC with a drift number — ATE 0.221 m over 73 m of path on MH_01**, and it is
> understood well enough to say what the number does and does not cover (settling
> transient 0.221 m, steady state 0.114 m, 90.5% path coverage, stereo not mono). Still
> open: **Isaac ROS + cuVSLAM in a container** and **Kalibr on a dataset** — neither has
> been started, both are pure learning curve, and the fall this list was written to
> protect has now begun.
